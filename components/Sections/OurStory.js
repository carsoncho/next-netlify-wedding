        <p>Every story has a beginning. This story started unexpectedly for both. Have you heard of the Office Romance? Yeap, that is where it started.</p>
        <p>Irina and Michael work side by side at the same company. During collaboration on a project, Irina used all of her tricks to get Michael’s attention. After some time, she made a bold decision to send Michael an email asking him out. Their first date was at Harris Public House where instant connection happened and it marked the beginning of their beautiful journey.</p>
        <p>They started spending all of their free time together: hiking, playing tennis, watching movies, camping,  cooking, hosting parties… Time was flying by, and the more they learned about each other the more they fell in love.</p>
        <p>One of the things that they have in common is a passion for traveling. The first trip they took together was during the Christmas holidays. What is better than a sunny beach of Mexico during cold winter in Missouri?! Michael, Irina, and Sasha enjoyed the time exploring this amazing country. It was another milestone in their life together. Traveling became a part of the relationships; Los Angeles, Herman, San Diego, islands of Belize, Guatemala is just a beginning of the world exploration.</p>
        <p>By the two-year mark they knew that they were meant for each other. Michael went above and beyond to propose to Irina and to make this day special and memorable. It all started with buying the ring that until this day blows people’s minds. Before asking Irina’s hand in marriage, Michael asked Sasha, his future stepson, for “permission”. Sasha approved! It was time to plan the proposal. With the help of friends and family, Michael proposed in Powell Gardens (one of Irina’s favorite places). The engagement surprise party was waiting for them at home. It was perfect!</p>
        <p>Now, as they stand on the precipice of their wedding day, Michael and Irina are filled with excitement for the future. They look forward to continuing their journey as partners, building a life rooted in love, understanding, and shared dreams. With hearts intertwined and a steadfast commitment, they eagerly anticipate the beautiful chapters yet to be written, knowing that their love will guide them through every moment, now and forever.</p>
